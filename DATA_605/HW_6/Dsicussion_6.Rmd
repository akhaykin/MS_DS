In how many ways can we choose five people from a group of ten to form a
committee?
 
```{r}
# Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members out of 10
n <- 10
r <- 5

# Using the combination formula
num_ways <- factorial(n) / (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))

# Print the result
cat("Number of ways to form a committee:", num_ways, "\n")
```
